# NFTLaunchKit - Coding Challenge

This project has been developed as part of a coding challenge by NFTLaunchKit.

The project is a Next.js project with TypeScript and tailwindcss. The website has been developed with a mobile-first approach meaning it got designed and developed for the phone layout first and then adjusted to fit bigger screen sizes. For the wallet connection RainbowKit has been used which in itself uses Wagmi.sh and ethers.js. It is possible to use all major wallet connectors to establish the connection to the website. The BAYC NFTs are fetched with the help of the Rarible API. Finally, the project has been deployed to Vercel.

The code itself should be rather self-explanatory. Wherever needed I added additional comments to further explain the code.
